=# Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project involves [briefly describe what the notebook does, e.g., "building a machine learning model to predict..."]. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Features
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, encoding.
- **Model Building**: Implementing models like [list the models, e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest].
- **Visualization**: Displaying data distributions and model performance metrics.
- **Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.11.5
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
